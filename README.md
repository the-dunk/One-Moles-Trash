## One Mole's Trash (Public Info)

One Mole's Trash is an upcoming time-management, mining, and shopkeeping game. Currently in early development, prototyping, determining systems, etc.

Eventually, post-release the goal is to make the source code available for others to use and potentially learn from, though that is still a long way off. This repo will be public indefinitely, though much of the content and progress will be private in the future while development is still ongoing. For now, feel free to look at the temporary models, prototype code, etc.
